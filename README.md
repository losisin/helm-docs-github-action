Install [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) tool and auto-generate Markdown documentation from Helm charts. It always uses latest version of `helm-docs`.

## Usage

To use this action, add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
name: Generate Helm documentation
on:
  - pull_request
jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
      - name: Run helm-docs
        uses: losisin/helm-docs-github-action@v1
```

### Fail on diff

To fail the workflow if there is a diff between the generated documentation and the committed one, add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
name: Generate Helm documentation
on:
  - pull_request
jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
      - name: Run helm-docs
        uses: losisin/helm-docs-github-action@v1
        with:
          fail-on-diff: true
```


### Auto commit generated documentation

> [!NOTE]
> For pull requests from a forked repo to the base repo,
> `git-push` will fail to push to the forked repo,
> unless you pass `Personal access tokens` of the forked repo owners
> to the base repo and map them to `head.repo`.
> Consider using `fail-on-diff: true` in this case.

> [!NOTE]
> The `git-push` option is ignored if `fail-on-diff: true`.

To automatically commit the generated documentation, add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
name: Generate Helm documentation
on:
  - pull_request
jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
      - name: Run helm-docs
        uses: losisin/helm-docs-github-action@v1
        with:
          git-push: true
```

To overwrite default user and email which is set to `github-actions[bot]` and add custom commit message, add the following:

```yaml
name: Generate Helm documentation
on:
  - pull_request
jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
      - name: Run helm-docs
        uses: losisin/helm-docs-github-action@v1
        with:
          input: values.yaml
          git-push: true
          git-push-user-name: "John Doe"
          git-push-user-email: "john.doe@example.com"
          git-commit-message: "chore: update Helm documentation"
